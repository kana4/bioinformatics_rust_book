# Biological File Types

Biological data is packaged in file types for targeted purposes. If a variant analysis was done, we might get back a variant call file ([VCF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format)), which will annotate variants from a genome reference. Sequencing Alignment Mapping ([SAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAM_(file_format))) files are usually a lot larger and contain all the sequencing data aligned to our genome reference. [Fasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files (not really short for anything) are the simplest of all; they only contain sequences and descriptions of the sequences.
