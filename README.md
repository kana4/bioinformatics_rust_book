# Bioinformatics Rust Blog


This is a small blog about bioinformatics in Rust. 

The blog is for beginners in computing and in bioinformatics, so I'll be starting from scratch. Please feel free to leave me a message [here](keybase.io/kana4) if there's something missing or if you want me to cover something and I'll be happy to write about it.
