<p>Hello user! You've found the book of bioinformatics in Rust. If you're a total beginner to anything bioinformatics, Rust, or programming, then this is the book for you. I hope it captures your interest like biology captured mine!</p>
<p>If you want to reach me or have something you want added to the book, let me know <a href="Chapter_1/keybase.io/kana4">here</a>!</p>
<h1 id="definitions-and-background"><a class="header" href="#definitions-and-background">Definitions and Background</a></h1>
<p>We'll start by going over a few things that aren't covered in other bioinformatics books but are necessary to understand building in Rust and systems programming. Page on!</p>
<h1 id="binary-vs-library"><a class="header" href="#binary-vs-library">Binary VS Library</a></h1>
<p>When we get a program, we click it, it'll open, and we'll be able to do stuff. We'll have to choose the program based on our operating system.</p>
<p>The program we're downloading is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable">binary, also known as an executable</a>: a bunch of operating system-specific operations amalgamated together so the computer can do the things we want it to in (hopefully) an efficient manner. You may have heard this word before on Windows as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.exe">.exe</a> file type  or just plain no file extension in Ubuntu or Linux. In Rust, we can make all of these file types really easily!</p>
<p>Binaries always have a main function, written <code>fn main(){}</code>. This main function is the Steve Jobs (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak">Woz</a>) of all things in our binary (random thought, did you know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs travelled through India</a> studying Zen Buddhism? Crazy). </p>
<p>Everything that will actually be done is in the main function, with other  functions, definitions, etc. being sourced from everywhere else. We build binaries by typing <code>cargo build --bin</code>.</p>
<p>The other kind of thing we make in Rust is a library. While we also build a library with <code>cargo build --lib</code>, a library does not have a program that we can just run like what we would imagine. This is because a library's purpose is to be a bunch of small, reusable pieces of code that we can use to make an executable, but aren't really useful to our users. As an analogy, a library is like a tool shed and the binary a house that the user lives in.</p>
<p>We will be building binaries in this book on the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=730c462d7171d22098403822416c698d">Rust playground</a>, a website where everything is already set up for us; there isn't any setup for this book! Each of the exercises will have a link to the playground with the exercise we're working on, it's that easy!</p>
<h1 id="ready-go"><a class="header" href="#ready-go">Ready Go</a></h1>
<p>Instead of going into a lot of detail, let's just start doing things!</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){

    // This is a comment within a function! 

}

</code></pre>
<p>Comments don't do anything in code because of the two // marks before the text and can be put anywhere</p>
<p>We need comments to let people know what we're doing in between code, and we'll use them to talk to you throughout code tutorials</p>

<pre><code>fn main(){
    // Make a variable a that holds 1
    let a = 1;
    // Make a variable b that holds 2
    let b = 2;
    // Add them together to get c
    let c = a + b;
    // Multiple by 3!
    let d = c * 3;
    // Divide by 3!
    let e = d / 3;

    // The variable e holds 3, but you'll have to take our word for it for now, we're going to print in the next few sections!
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="semicolons"><a class="header" href="#semicolons">Semicolons</a></h1>
<p>What's the point of the semicolons? Aren't we just typing a new thing we want to do on a new line anyway? In Python and R, we continue what we're doing by going to a new line.</p>
<p>In Rust, semicolons separate the steps of a function. This means we could just type everything on one line separated by semicolons, even though this would look kind of weird. Going to a new line isn't necessary, but makes it look nicer like in Python and R.</p>
<p>In Rust, the whole binary is run like a single function, thus the main function structure. This means that if we don't have a semicolon, we'll return whatever we get from the non-semicolon line, the main function will end, and so will our program. If we want to return something from a function, we don't need to type <code>return</code>, we just leave out a semicolon!</p>
<h1 id="print-numbers"><a class="header" href="#print-numbers">Print Numbers</a></h1>
<p>Let's print something!</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    println!(&quot;42&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=85ae37adbe96892255eab588c99912fe">playground</a></p>
<p>Well that was pretty easy, we didn't even need the semicolon because we end the main function after printing. Now instead of printing directly, let's try printing something in a variable.</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    // Make a variable x that holds 1
    let x = 1;

    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x)

}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have a variable, <code>println!</code> takes two parts, the first is formatting the print, while the second part is the variable to print. the quotes surround everything that will be printed, in our case, <code>{}</code> which is always the input variable. So we have stated to print only the variable. We probably want to other things than just deal with numbers though, so let's try to </p>
<h1 id="comparing-printing-strings"><a class="header" href="#comparing-printing-strings">Comparing Printing Strings</a></h1>
<p>I'll just come out and say it: in other interpreted languages, it's really simple to do things. Let's go with the classic, printing &quot;Hello World!&quot;.</p>
<p>Python: </p>
<p><code>thing = &quot;Hello World!&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>print(thing)</code></p>
<p>R:</p>
<p><code>thing = &quot;Hello World!&quot;</code></p>
<p><code>print(thing)</code></p>
<p>And comparatively in Rust:</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    let thing=&quot;Hello World!&quot;;
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, thing);
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=b7a9925991302bdd3802fa2a25c89d0e">playground</a></p>
<p>Why is it so much longer in Rust? With great power comes having to be specific! Let's break it down based on what we learned so far.</p>
<p>We're building a binary, which is why we have the main function, <code>fn main(){}</code>. </p>
<p>Inside the main function, we create a variable <code>thing</code> that stores <code>&quot;Hello World!&quot;</code> We put the <code>thing</code> variable into <code>println!</code>, where <code>&quot;{}&quot;</code> is just our variable, and the second input is the actual variable to be printed. We could also print something more fun like:</p>
<p><code>Our variable contains: Hello World!</code> </p>
<p>by typing:</p>
<p><code>println!(&quot;Our variable contains: {}&quot;, thing);</code></p>

<p>Congratulations, you cleared level 2! It was a bunch of sections, but we learned some programming building blocks that we'll continue to use for the rest of our career. Time to take a break!</p>

<h1 id="vectors"><a class="header" href="#vectors">Vectors</a></h1>
<p>We made a string in the prior section, so let's make it's simpler cousin, the vector!</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    let thing_of_things = vec![1,2,3,4];
}
</code></pre>
<p>What <em>is</em> a vector exactly? A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/vec.html">vector</a> in Rust is a sequence of things, in our case the numbers 1,2,3,4 one after the other. This is also referred to as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type">composite</a> type because a vector is made of multiple smaller things. We could also make the vector with the following:</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    let thing1 = 1;
    let thing2 = 2;
    let thing3 = 3;
    let thing4 = 4;

    let thing_of_things = vec![thing1,thing2,thing3,thing4];
}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="printing-vectors-and-debug-mode"><a class="header" href="#printing-vectors-and-debug-mode">Printing Vectors and Debug Mode</a></h1>
<p>If you look closely, we didn't print the vector just yet, for that we need something called <code>debug</code>!</p>
<p>Debug is something new if you're coming from other languages like R or Python, and it's something that we don't really need to know so we'll just leave it at: <em>We neeeeeeed it!</em> At least for vectors.</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    let thing_of_things = vec![1,2,3,4];
    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;,thing_of_things)
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=b94f6fadd0cb4b684b29f22803547f0d">playground</a></p>
<p>Can you spot the debug notation? It's the <code>:?</code> inside the <code>{}</code>! Rust is super smart, if we didn't have the debug and just wrote <code>println!(&quot;{}&quot;,thing_of_things)</code> like in our prior examples, we'd get an error like this:</p>
<p><code>the trait std::fmt::Display is not implemented</code></p>
<p>But we'd also get this:</p>
<p><code>in format strings you may be able to use {:?} (or {:#?} for pretty-print) instead</code></p>
<p>The first option is exactly what we needed, which leads us to the golden rule: figure out the output Rust gives us. Rust is pretty smart, it'll probably give us some useful clues (and in this case the exact fix) to what to do if we get an error!</p>
<h1 id="dot-notation"><a class="header" href="#dot-notation">Dot Notation</a></h1>
<p>In Rust and a few other programming languages, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming)#Dot_notation">dot notation</a>.
Dot notation is used when we have a thing and we want to do something with it. In pseudo programming English if I wanted to say: </p>
<p>&quot;cut apple&quot;</p>
<p>With dot notation it would look something like: </p>
<p><code>apple.cut();</code></p>
<p>where we have an apple and we want to cut it. Let's use dot notation with a vector!</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    
    // Make a vector holding the numbers 1,2,3,4

    let vector = vec![1,2,3,4];

    // Use dot notation with len(), a function to get the length of a vector

    let length_of_vector = vector.len();

    // Print the value stored in length_of_vector, which is the length of the vector

    println!(&quot;{}&quot;,length_of_vector)

}
</code></pre>

<p>Congrats! We've not only used our first dot notation, our first function! It doesn't seem like it now, but <code>len()</code> is a workhorse for Rust programmers of all levels. Dot notation will help us be more concise and expressive in our programming. We want our programs (as) short and sweet (as possible).</p>

<p>Vectors are used in Python and R as one of the main objects and it's no different in Rust, but Rust also has many alternatives that can make things faster and more efficient. If you're doing millions of calculations, any small bit counts! This is one of the great things about Rust: where other languages are limited, Rust doesn't have limits. We'll cover some of the features that make Rust much more powerful than the interpreted languages in the next chapter!</p>

<h1 id="references"><a class="header" href="#references">References</a></h1>
<p><em>Warning: Difficult Section!</em></p>
<p>References are one way to make code super efficient. The general idea is that we have some data and we want to reuse the data. In Python or R, we just have the data in a variable and that variable is copied over and over again whenever we want to use it. In most cases, we could have just made and stored the data once, and just referred to it other times.</p>
<p>In a more concrete example, Rust makes a book (our data), stores it on a shelf, and whenever someone wants some information from the book, we  let them know where the book is on the shelf rather than making a copy of the whole book. Making copies of a book in the real world is expensive; the same holds true in computation. On the other hand, our new method not only saves us the time of copying a whole book, but means we don't have to walk to the shelf ourselves, and lets us direct a revolving door of people that want books.</p>
<p>References are a new concept comparing to Python and R, let's see what it would look like in a code block</p>

<p>We've covered a few Rust and programming concepts so far, but we aren't writing a book on Rust basics; we can't write a better book than the creators of the language! We want to focus on doing things in bioinformatics, so from here we're going to link background information in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">Rust books</a> or this book's index for bioinformatics background. Next, making characters into numbers!</p>

<h1 id="characters"><a class="header" href="#characters">Characters</a></h1>
<p>Before we get into biological data, we first need to be able to give the computer knowledge of what an alphabet, or even a character is. Computers can only understand numbers, so how do we tell it we want alphabet characters? One way to do that is to choose a number for each character in some systematic way. One method could be instead of ABC we save 123 if we're using the location in the alphabet as our integer. Since we know the alphabet, we can store numbers and still know what the numbers are supposed to say, and convert back and forth between numbers and characters.</p>
<p>Most commonly, this is done with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">bytes</a>. When your internet company's talking about speeds, megabits are different from megabytes (8 bits to a byte)! Each byte most commonly represents a character like A or T, but instead of A or T, it's a number. Since each number represents a character, we can write a word as a vector of numbers. In our first example of 'ABC', it would just be <code>vec![1,2,3]</code>.</p>
<p>In practice, 'A' isn't stored as 1, but as '65' in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII alphabet</a> and '41' in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. This is to be useful to users and computers around the world; UTF-8 has a ton of stuff, even <a href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html">emojis</a>!</p>

<h1 id="biological-sequences"><a class="header" href="#biological-sequences">Biological Sequences</a></h1>
<p>In this chapter, we're going to start working with biological data, finally!</p>
<p>DNA classically contains the four bases ACTG, whereas RNA includes ACUG. In sequencing data, we usually encode RNA data as ACTG for ease of use, and notate that the file is RNA data. We also commonly include 'N', where we're unsure of what base goes there but we think there's something there. </p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    // DNA vector, RNA is commonly encoded the same way
    let dna = b&quot;ACTG&quot;.to_vec();
    // DNA vector containing a base we're unsure of, but think it's present.
    let dna_with_n = b&quot;ACTNG&quot;.to_vec();
</code></pre>
<h1 id="biological-vector"><a class="header" href="#biological-vector">Biological Vector</a></h1>
<p>In the previous section, we created a biological sequence and made it into a vector with <code>to_vec()</code>. </p>
<p>We've created a vector of ACTG and that the vector doesn't hold characters, but bytes. Now that the computer has an idea of a biological sequence, we can start working with our biological data just like any other numeric vector! This includes things that we're more familiar with from math, and in this section we'll do something that we can only do once we've made our characters into numbers: find the sum! What's the sum of 'ACTG'? Let's find out!</p>
<pre><code>fn main(){
    let dna = b&quot;ACTG&quot;.to_vec();
    let mut sum = 0;
    for base in dna {
        sum += base;
    }
    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, sum);
}

<p>// index 
Mutable variables are variables that can change. Normally in Rust when we write <code>let</code> the variable cannot change, <code>mut</code> let's the program know that it should expect this variable to change. </p>
<p>+= is shorthand notation for adding to a variable similar to the following pseudocode example:</p>
<pre><code>x += y is the same as:
x = x + y
</code></pre>
<p>In short, it means set our first variable on the left hand side <a href="Chapter_5/">lhs</a> to itself plus something.</p>
<p>How to make for loops in Rust. Our for loop here takes the vector and for each element (<code>base</code>) adds to our variable <code>sum</code>.</p>
<h1 id="check-sequence"><a class="header" href="#check-sequence">Check Sequence</a></h1>
<p>Calculating the sum of a sequence is pretty cool, but probably isn't very useful to us in a direct sense. Let's do something with a little more direct application: checking if our sequence is a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/homopolymer">homopolymer</a>!</p>
<p>There's a few steps we're going to do here:</p>
<ul> Store the first element of our sequence in a variable to compare to the other elements </ul>
<ul> Create a separate vector where each element is a boolean true/false. Rust gives us a really nice macro (vec![]) to make an empty vector. </ul>
<ul> For each element in our sequence, check if the element is the same as the first element and push the result into our boolean vector. </ul>
<ul> Print our boolean vector to see our results! </ul>
<pre><code>fn main(){

    let vector = b&quot;AAAAA&quot;.to_vec();
    
    let first_element = vector[0];
        
    let mut boolean_vector: Vec&lt;bool&gt; = vec![];

    // For each element, true or false: is the same as the first element    
    for element in vector {
        boolean_vector.push(first_element == element)
    }

    println!(&quot;{:?}&quot;, boolean_vector);

}

<p><em>Note:</em> There's always more than one way to do things in Rust. Can you think of other ways to test whether a sequence is a homopolymer?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous integration</a> (CI) is fancy terminology for automatically testing stuff when we publish code. If we could, we would run our code on a factory-fresh computer and document everything we did to have our code running. In continuous integration, we make a computer make a virtual computer doing exactly this. The virtual computer will be factory-fresh, and our continuous integration instructions will tell it to install prerequisites, move files, anything we need to have our code running. We then test to see if our code runs, and if it doesn't the code doesn't pass CI tests.</p>
