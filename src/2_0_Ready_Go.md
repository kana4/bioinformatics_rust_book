# Ready Go

Instead of going into a lot of detail, let's just start doing things!

```
fn main(){

    // This is a comment within a function! 

}

```


Comments don't do anything in code because of the two // marks before the text and can be put anywhere

We need comments to let people know what we're doing in between code, and we'll use them to talk to you throughout code tutorials
