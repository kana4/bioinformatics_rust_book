# Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide

```
fn main(){
    // Make a variable a that holds 1
    let a = 1;
    // Make a variable b that holds 2
    let b = 2;
    // Add them together to get c
    let c = a + b;
    // Multiple by 3!
    let d = c * 3;
    // Divide by 3!
    let e = d / 3;

    // The variable e holds 3, but you'll have to take our word for it for now, we're going to print in the next few sections!
}
```
