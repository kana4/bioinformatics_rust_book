# Notes
Why would we choose to write in low level languages? Most of the time, people don't write in these verbose languages exactly because it's time consuming, takes a lot of thinking, and ends up being much more code. If it is possible, we recommend using high level languages, which is why the popular interpreted languages are listed in the [List of Bioinformatics Tools](./7_List_Of_Bioinformatics_Tools.md).

Really if you can't do it in a high-level language, it's because someone in a low level language hasn't made it yet. The high level languages are mostly functions in another language that are build with (probably) a C++ backend.

You'll also hear about these languages being really fast and super efficient. In essence, almost all computing relies on these languages.

We also have to change directory to the home folder and type `cargo build bioinfo`, in addition to also running the program with `./target/debug/bioinfo`. What does all of this mean? Don't worry, we'll break it down in the next section.
