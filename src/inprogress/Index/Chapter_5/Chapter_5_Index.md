Mutable variables are variables that can change. Normally in Rust when we write `let` the variable cannot change, `mut` let's the program know that it should expect this variable to change. 

+= is shorthand notation for adding to a variable similar to the following pseudocode example:

```
x += y is the same as:
x = x + y
```

In short, it means set our first variable on the left hand side [lhs]() to itself plus something.


How to make for loops in Rust. Our for loop here takes the vector and for each element (`base`) adds to our variable `sum`.
