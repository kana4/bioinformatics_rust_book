# Iteration 

*Warning: Difficult Section!*

We now know that vectors are made of smaller pieces of data; what if we wanted to do something for each part (element) of our vector? 

Each language has multiple ways to do something for each element of our vector. In Python and R, we could write a `for` or a `while` loop, something like:

```
# Python

```

```
# R

vector = c(1,2,3,4)
for (i in 1:length(vector)) {

}
```

This is sometimes referred to as a process called iteration.
