# Setup

We'll be building binaries in this book on the [Rust playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=730c462d7171d22098403822416c698d), a website where everything is already set up for us; ! Each of the exercises will have a link to the playground with the exercise we're working on, it's that easy!
