# Add and Subtract

```
fn main(){
    // Make a variable x that holds 1
    let x = 1;
    // Make a variable y that holds 2
    let y = 2;
    // Add them together to get z
    let z = x + y;

    // The variable z holds 3, but you'll have to take our word for it for now, we're going to print in the next few sections!
}
```
