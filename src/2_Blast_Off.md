# Setup
Hello world! Well, not quite yet; we need to learn a little bit about how things work in the computer world so we can talk to the computer from our human world and *vice versa*. In the process, we'll set up everything to give the computer instructions and write programs. Throughout the book, we'll also give shortcuts and tools that *really* help speed things up.

There are a few things on our *TODO* list and we refer you to the original sources as these will give you better instructions than we can:

[Install and Configure Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

[Install VSCode](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

[Install Rustlings for More Fun](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)

[Install Lolcat](https://asciinema.org/a/236096)
