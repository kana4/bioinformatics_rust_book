# Notes
Why would we choose to write in low level languages? Most of the time, people don't write in these verbose languages exactly because it's time consuming, takes a lot of thinking, and ends up being much more code. If it is possible, we recommend using high level languages, which is why the popular interpreted languages are listed in the [List of Bioinformatics Tools](./7_List_Of_Bioinformatics_Tools.md).

Really if you can't do it in a high-level language, it's because someone in a low level language hasn't made it yet. The high level languages are mostly functions in another language that are build with (probably) a C++ backend.

You'll also hear about these languages being really fast and super efficient. In essence, almost all computing relies on these languages.

## Note 2
There's an incredible number of data structures and types in Rust, with each one having specific trade offs. Don't worry about it and just stick to Vec<u8> for now. We can build on the shoulders of giants with the core and standard library.
