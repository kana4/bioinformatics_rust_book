# Notes on Vectors

Vectors are used in Python and R as one of the main objects and it's no different in Rust, but Rust also has many alternatives that can make things faster and more efficient. If you're doing millions of calculations, any small bit counts! We won't talk about these options yet, but this is one of the great things about Rust: where other languages are limited, Rust doesn't have limits.
