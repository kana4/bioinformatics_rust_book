# Align Sequences

You've gathered genomic data on a martian lily and now have a bunch of sequencing data; it's time for alignment! Alignment to a genomic reference is an essential bioinformatics task.

The idea: compare the sequences we've collected to a genomic reference and return the positions in the reference the sequences match to. 

The nitty gritty: our data is in fragments, and our genomic reference could be pretty large (it's a whole genome of data!).

There are a few methods to tackle these problems, but we won't get into them here (but there are a few resources in the appendix!). We'll just get er' done with a few convenient Rust bioinformatics libraries!
