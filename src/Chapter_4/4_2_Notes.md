# Notes

We've covered a few Rust and programming concepts so far, but we aren't writing a book on Rust basics; we can't write a better book than the creators of the language! We want to focus on doing things in bioinformatics, so from here we're going to link background information in the [Rust books](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or this book's index for bioinformatics background. Next, making characters into numbers!
